# Java ME jadtool (for Linux)

Fork of Phone-J2ME midp in order to build a (more) modern Java ME jadtool for Linux
(compared to [Sun Java Wireless Toolkit 2.5.2 available from Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/javame/javame-sdk/downloads/java-me-sdk-3-0-1849684.html)).

## Building

Check out the source code and run `ant package`. Binary can be found in `target/lib`.
